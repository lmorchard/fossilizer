This is maybe an attempt to build a static site generator for Mastodon export tarballs.

## TODO

- [ ] include actor info in site header?
- [ ] special index just for activities with media attachments?
- [ ] navigation between media attachments in dialog, prev & next
- [ ] fetch outbox url for incremental imports
- [ ] build pagefind indices
- [ ] GitHub pages publish action?
- [ ] automated cross platform build on GitHub
- [ ] try [tinysearch](https://github.com/tinysearch/tinysearch) to index individual activities and link to within-page anchors?
